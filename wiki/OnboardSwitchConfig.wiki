# On-board switch configuration

= On-board switch configuration =

A configuration block needs to be added manually to /etc/config/network. Please login via SSH and edit this file, adding:
{{{
config switch
        option name 'eth0'
        option reset '1'
        option enable_vlan '1'
}}}

And run the following to reload the networking configuration:
{{{
/etc/init.d/network restart
}}}

Then refresh the web management page, you'll see a "Switch" under "Network" menu. Enter and configure what you need if you want to use VLAN, etc...
